# Arduino-Project-4WD
The Whack-a-Mole Arduino autonomous robot was meticulously crafted as part of the ME384  Mechatronic course project for the esteemed Mechanical Engineering department at Bilkent University. https://youtu.be/_2Zh_5En2zQ
in a game of robotic whack a mole you will be placing mole whackers cubes on squares with moles the squares that moles are occupying
will be identified by color with the field having three different color squares not including the starting Square which will be white
at the start of each game ATA will tell you the color of the squares where moles are hiding your robot must then autonomously search the playing field
for the moles and place mole whackers on those squares Morrow is unique because of its movement algorithm let's assume
the blue thing on white square is Morrow where the triangles and ellipses are distance in color sensors respectively
after the round has begun Maro will go forward until it centers the last two
squares then Maro will rotate 90. after the rotation marrow will detect color and shots the whack-a-mole to the Target
color Square until Maro faces the wall Mauro continues to go and shoot the moles later Maro will starts to go right until
it centers the last two square of its horizontal line
for final time Morrow rotates and it goes until it detects the white one
after it detects white one it will go right and turn itself down
